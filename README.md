# Objects Lab

## Problem Statement

We covered the concepts of `Object`s in JavaScript. Now it's time to put the
concepts into practice.

## Objectives

1.  Create `Object`s
2.  Perform operations on `Object`s

## Instructions

Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve. In particular, you'll need to define a `driver` `Object`
and then apply certain updates (destructively and non-destructively) in various
functions.

You'll be writing four functions:

- `updateDriverWithKeyAndValue()`- this function should take in a `driver`
  `Object`, a `key` and a `value`. The function should not mutate the `driver`
  parameter and return a new `driver` that has an updated `value` for the `key`
  passed in.
- `destructivelyUpdateDriverWithKeyAndValue()` - this function should work the
  same as `updateDriverWithKeyAndValue()` but it _should_ mutate the `driver`
  parameter passed in.
- `deleteFromDriverByKey()` - this function should take in a `driver` `Object` and
  a `key`. It should delete the `key`/`value` pair for the `key` that was passed
  in from the `driver` `Object`. This should all not actually mutate the `driver`
  passed in.
- `destructivelyDeleteFromDriverByKey()` - this function should work the same as
  `deleteFromDriverByKey()` but it _should_ mutate the `driver` passed in.

**HINT**: You might find `deleteFromDriverByKey()` to be a bit hard to write
non-destructively. Think about how we learned to use `Object.assign()`. What
happens if we do this:

```js
const obj = { foo: "bar" };

const newObj = Object.assign({}, obj);

newObj;
// => { foo: "bar" }

delete newObj.foo;
// => true

newObj;
// => {}

obj;
// => { foo: "bar" }
```

Something to keep in mind!

## Conclusion

In this lab, we worked with creating `Object`s and performing operations on
them.
